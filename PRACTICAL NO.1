1. Install DHCP Server in Ubuntu 16.04 

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is
a network protocol that is used to enable host
computers to be automatically assigned IP addresses
and related network configurations from
a server.
The IP address assigned by a DHCP server 
to DHCP client is on a “lease”, 
the lease time normally varies depending
on how long a client computer is likely
to require the connection or DHCP configuration.
Command for  installing dhcp server on ubuntu
