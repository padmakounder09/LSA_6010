Aim: install Samba to share folders or files between windows and linux 


Samba server
Samba is an open-source software suite that runs on Unix/Linux based platforms but is able to communicate with Windows clients like a native application.

Step1: Installtion of  samba 

sudo apt update s

sudo apt install samba

Command to  check whether it is installed:

whereis samba

Step2: configure  samba server 

mkdir /home/<username>/sambashare/

The command above creates a new folder sambashare in our home directory which we will share later.

The configuration file for Samba is located at 

/etc/samba/smb.conf 

To add the new directory as a share, we edit the file by running:

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

At the bottom of the file, add the following lines:

[sharedfolder] comment = secured shared folder 
path = /srv/samba/securedfolder 
Valid users = @selected 
guest ok = no 
writable = yes 
browsable = yes


Step 3:Restart smbd service 

sudo systemctl restart smbd.service nmbd.service

Update the firewall rules to allow Samba traffic:

sudo ufw allow samba

Step 4: Access Samba shared files 

Now we need to access what we’ve shared. We can use the smbclient utility to access Windows shared files. We can list the shared files like this:
$ smbclient -L localhost -U%  

Step 5: Creating Samba users 

To create a samba entry for an existing system user, use the pdbedit command:
$ pdbedit -a kali
The new user will be created in the Samba default user database which is /var/lib/samba/private/passdb.tdb file.
With a Samba user created, we can make the shares available only to authenticated users,
This user can access his resources on Samba server using smbclient like this:
$ smbclient -U kali -L //192.168.1.3
Restart now
$sudo systemctl restart smbd
$sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.3/24 to any samba
Adding rule
Sudo ufw reload
