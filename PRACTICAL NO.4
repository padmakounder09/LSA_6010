Aim: Configure NFS server to share directories on your network,NFS client (ubuntu and windows client host)

NFS, or Network File System, is a distributed file system protocol that allows you to mount remote directories on your server. 
This lets you manage storage space in a different location and write to that space from multiple clients. NFS provides a 
relatively quick and easy way to access remote systems over a network and works well in situations where the shared resources will be accessed regularly.

Step1 : Downloading and Installing  the components

On the Host
On the host server, we will install the  package, 

nfs-kernel-server

which will allow us to share our directories.we’ll refresh our local package index before the installation

• $ sudo apt-get update 

• $ sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server 

Once these packages are installed, switch to the client server.

On the client server, we need to install a package called 

nfs-common

which provides NFS functionality without including unneeded server components. 
 we will refresh the local package index prior to installation to ensure that we have up-to-date information:

• $ sudo apt-get update 

• $ sudo apt-get install nfs-common

Step 2: Create the Export Directory
The directory that we want to share with the client system is called an export directory.
WE can name it according to our choice;
here, we are creating an export directory by the name of “sharedfolder” in our system’s
mnt(mount) directory.

$ sudo mkdir -p /mntsharedfolder

As we want all clients to access the directory, we will remove restrictive permissions of the export folder through the following commands:

$ sudo chown nobody:nogroup /mnt/sharedfolder

$ sudo chmod 777 /mnt/sharedfolder

Step 3: Assign server access to client(s) through NFS export file
After creating the export folder, we will need to provide the clients the permission to access the host server machine. This permission is defined through the exports file located in your system’s /etc folder. 

$ sudo nano /etc/exports

Editing this file needs root access; therefore you will need to use sudo with your command.
A single client by adding the following line in the file:

/mnt/sharedfolder clientIP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)

Multiple clients, by specifying an entire subnet that the clients belong to:
/mnt/sharedfolder subnetIP/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check

The permissions “rw,sync,no_subtree_check” permissions defined in this file mean that the client(s) can perform:

rw: read and write operations

sync: write any change to the disc before applying it
no_subtree_check: prevent subtree checking

Step 4: Export the shared directory

$ sudo exportfs -a
Finally, in order to make all the configurations take effect, restart the NFS Kernel server as follows:

$ sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server

Step 5: Open firewall for the client (s)
An important step is to verify that the server’s firewall is open to the clients so that they can access the shared content.

$ sudo ufw allow from [clientIP or clientSubnetIP] to any port nfs

$ sudo ufw allow from 192.168.100/24 to any port nfs

$ sudo ufw status


Configuring the Client Machine

Step 1: Install NFS Common

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install nfs-common
The system will prompt you with a Y/n option to confirm if you want to continue with the installation. Please enter Y and then hit Enter to continue, after which the software will be successfully installed on your system.

Step 2: Create a mount point for the NFS host’s shared folder
Your client’s system needs a directory where all the content shared by the host server in the export folder can be accessed. You can create this folder anywhere on your system. We are creating a mount folder in the mnt directory of our client’s machine:

$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sharedfolder_client

Step 3: Mount the shared directory on the client
Mount the shared folder from the host to a mount folder on the client:

$ sudo mount serverIP:/exportFolder_server /mnt/mountfolder_client

$ sudo mount 192.168.100.5:/mnt/sharedfolder /mnt/sharedfolder_client

Step 4: Test the connection
Please create or save a file in the export folder of the NFS host server. Now, open the mount folder on the client machine; you should be able to view the same file shared and accessible in this folder.
